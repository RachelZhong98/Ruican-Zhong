I am a 1st year HCDE (Human-Centered Design and Engineering) PhD student at the University of Washington. My current research interest is to understand and evaluate machine learning systems from a user perspective. I am especially excited about designing responsible AI-driven systems that can facilitate people's daily interactions and promote behavior change. I am currently rotating with Dr. David McDonald and Dr. Gary Hsieh.


Previously, I have conducted HCI research at [GT SPUD (Security, Privacy, Usability and Design) Lab](https://gtspuds.com/) under the supervision of [Dr. Sauvik Das](https://sauvikdas.com/) during my undergrad. I am also volunteering at [Berkeley SETI  Research Center](https://seti.berkeley.edu/listen/), building ML-based pipelines in astrophysics under the supervision of Dr. Andrew Siemon and [Dr. Steve Croft](https://astro.berkeley.edu/people/steve-croft/).
