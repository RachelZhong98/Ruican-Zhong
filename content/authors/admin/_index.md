I am a 3rd year HCDE (Human-Centered Design and Engineering) PhD student at the University of Washington, advised by [David McDonald](http://www.pensivepuffin.com/dwmcphd/index.html) and [Gary Hsieh](http://faculty.washington.edu/garyhs/). I have 4+ years of experience in mixed-method end-to-end HCI research and design. ([UX Research Portfolio](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1ue8k5tEiOC_V-JmBru1b7ewe8PqR-87UV6yXBMVwan0/edit?usp=sharing))

My research interest is in designing and evaluating *interactive machine learning systems* from a user perspective. I am particularly excited about **designing and implementing AI-driven systems** that can facilitate **online interaction and collaboration**, focusing on understanding the role that AI systems play in such interactions. Recently, I am working on **the design and development of LLM-driven interactive systems for UX designers**.

Previously, I have conducted HCI research at [GT SPUD (Security, Privacy, Usability and Design) Lab](https://gtspuds.com/) under the supervision of [Dr. Sauvik Das](https://sauvikdas.com/) during my undergrad. I have also interned at [Berkeley SETI  Research Center](https://seti.berkeley.edu/listen/), building ML-based pipelines in astrophysics under the supervision of Dr. Andrew Siemon and [Dr. Steve Croft](https://astro.berkeley.edu/people/steve-croft/).
