title: Cloak Cam (Subversive ML)
summary: "People often feel concerned about posting pictures online (e.g. Photos taken at a protest) due to existing surveillance mechanisms driven by facial recognition algorithms. We investigate how to resolve this tension by empowering the users with tools to protect their privacy. We built an Android application that applies human imperceptible perturbation to an image to protect it against state-of-the-art facial recognition models. Currently, we are invesigating the level of perturbation the users are willing to accept given provided privacy."
